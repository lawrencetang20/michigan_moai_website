          <h1>About Michigan Moai</h1>
          <p>
            <strong>Michigan Moai</strong> is a nonprofit organization committed to supporting the mental health and well-being of AANHPI (Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander) individuals across Michigan. Our mission is to ensure that those facing trauma, racism, or language barriers have access to culturally competent and linguistically appropriate mental health care.
          </p>
          <p>
            The name “Moai” comes from a Japanese concept meaning “meeting for a common purpose.” Traditionally, moai are lifelong social support groups that offer emotional and financial assistance while creating a strong sense of belonging. At Michigan Moai, we embrace this philosophy by building networks of care that alleviate stress, promote healing, and serve as a safety net for our community.
          </p>
          <p>
            We work to identify therapists across Michigan and PSYPACT states who speak AANHPI languages and have experience supporting trauma survivors. Our goal is to connect individuals to the right care through a searchable referral database for therapy sessions. Through strong community partnerships and a commitment to culturally responsive services, we aim to make mental health support more accessible and inclusive for all.

            At Boston University, Elizabeth works as a research assistant in two labs. In the Family Development & Treatment Lab, she collaborates with MIT’s Gabrielli Lab on studies investigating how depression and the parent-child relationship affect brain development in children ages 7–12. She also conducts research in the Sexual, Reproductive, and Mental Health (SRM) Disparities Program, which explores the intersection of mental, sexual, and reproductive health in marginalized populations. The program aims to identify psychological barriers to care and develop culturally responsive interventions to improve health outcomes both locally and globally in South Africa.    </div>
