        <h2>Anti-Bullying Workshop <span class="project-date">| July 2025</span></h2>
        <p>
          Our nonprofit led an interactive anti-bullying workshop for the Asian American youth summer camp hosted by ACA in Detroit. The session focused on empowering campers to recognize, respond to, and prevent bullying—particularly forms rooted in racism, xenophobia, and cultural stigma. Through group discussions, role-playing, and culturally relevant scenarios, participants built skills in assertive communication, allyship, and community care within a safe and supportive environment. The workshop emphasized the importance of identity, solidarity, and mental wellness in creating inclusive spaces for Asian American youth.

        <p>
          In the summer of 2024, our nonprofit provided a culturally responsive counselor training workshop for a Chinese American youth summer camp. The training focused on equipping camp counselors with tools to support campers' mental health, address identity-related challenges, and foster inclusive, affirming spaces. Emphasis was placed on cultural humility, communication strategies, and recognizing the unique experiences of Chinese American youth in intergenerational and bicultural contexts.

        <h2>Bubble Tea Mental Health Workshop <span class="project-date">| December 2024</span></h2>
        <p>
          In December 2024, a hands-on workshop—hosted in partnership with American Citizens for Justice and the Michigan Asian Pacific American Association—invited high school students to engage in mental health awareness and activism through a unique and interactive experience. Participants had the opportunity to create and customize their own boba drinks, fostering a fun and welcoming environment for connection and self-expression. Alongside the activity, students learned about the importance of mental health advocacy and the role of peer support in building healthier school communities. The workshop also introduced outreach opportunities, encouraging students to take on leadership roles by joining a youth mental health advisory committee, where they could contribute their voices to future initiatives and help shape mental health programming for their peers.
